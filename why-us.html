<h3>Should I List My House With An Agent Or Sell It To A Cash Buyer? </h3>
<p>A lot of people tend to think that listing with an agent is always the right choice.
   This is just not true. There are times when listing with an agent is the right thing to do,
    and times when it's not, or not even a possibility. We are here to point you in the right direction.
     If listing with an agent is the right solution for you, we'll tell you! </p>
<h4>You should list with an agent if:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>You don't mind waiting the 2 to 6+ months your house will be on the market</li>
  <li>You're able to pay the 2 to 6+ months of holding costs (taxes, lawn maintenance, utilities, insurance, etc)</li>
  <li>Your house is in near-perfect condition with recent updates</li>
  <li>You are in no hurry to sell</li>
  <li>You are ok with putting some work into the house to improve it's appeal (fresh paint, new carpets, landscaping, window coverings & light fixtures, etc)</li>
  <li>You are ok with making the house available to random strangers to walk through and nit-pick what they don't like</li>
  <li>You don't care when your closing takes place</li>
</ul>
<p>If the above bullets describe you, then list with an agent! You will probably be able to sell the house for a little more by doing those things,
  instead of selling directly to a cash buyer. </p>
<p>Although it's obvious when to list, it's not as obvious when NOT to list or when to pursue a cash buyer. The only time listing with an agent makes financial sense 
  is when you would still get enough for the house, after all fees and commissions are deducted, to still be on-top while taking into consideration the work, effort, and money it takes to list with the agent. </p>
  <p>As you can see now, selling to a cash buyer is a very valid option. If you are wondering “I need to sell my house fast” keep this in mind: Cash buyers are not agents and usually there are no closing costs or
     agent fees to pay. Also  purchases are as is, which means there is no need for repairs. Think about it before you list with an agent!</p>
